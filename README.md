# A Propagated Skeleton Approach to High ThroughputScreening of Neurite Outgrowth forin vitro Parkinson’s Disease Modelling
![Pipeline example scheme](/example/pipeline_scheme_example.png?raw=true "Pipeline example scheme")

****

Neuronal *in vitro* models of neurodegenerative diseases such as *Parkinson’s Disease* are extensively studied in pathological and therapeutical research with neurite outgrowth being a core feature.
Screening of neurite outgrowth enables characterization of various stimuli and therapeutic effects after lesion.
In this study, we describe a computational assay for high throughput skeletonization approach allowing for quantification of neurite outgrowth in large data sets from fluorescence microscopic imaging.
Development and validation of the assay was conducted with differentiated *SH-SY5Y* cells treated with the neurotoxic lesioning compound Rotenone reducing neurite outgrowth in a concentration-dependent manner up to 70.7%.
Results of manual annotation using [NeuronJ](https://github.com/imagescience/NeuronJ/) and automated data were shown to correlate strongly.
This automated neurite length algorithm constitutes a valuable tool for *in vitro* modelling of neurite outgrowth that can be easily applied to evaluate therapeutic compounds with high throughput approaches.
